Krautflare workers are the newest breakthrough in serverless computing. And since we're taking security very seriously, we're even isolating customer workloads from each other!

For our demo, we added an ancient v8 vulnerability to show that it's un-exploitable!
See https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1710 for details.
Fortunately, that was the last vulnerability in v8 and our product will be secure from now on.

Note:
This challenge is hard! It's made for all the people who asked for a hard Chrome pwnable in this survey at https://twitter.com/_tsuro/status/1057676059586560000. Though the bug linked above gives you a rough walkthrough how to exploit it, you'll just have to figure out the details. I hope you paid attention in your compiler lectures :). Good luck, you have been warned!
